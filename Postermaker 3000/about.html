      Hello dear user on the internet. This magnificent tool is called the POSTERMAKER 3000. It makes posters, it's in the name
      Do with this tool what you want. Make posters for any kind of use. Reference the code if you want to. Hell, copy it if you want.
      Though I'd advise against. Quick thanks to the P5js editor and Ted Davis for helping reduce the amount of mental breakdowns and aiding in putting this together.
